# TODO: Clean up git repositories
# Create a script that will tidy up all repos at the end of day,
# making sure that all master branches are up to date, and I get some insight on 
# commits that aren't in master.
# Delete irrelevant branches locally and remotely
# Check that my remotes suit my convention
